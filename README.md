# Y-type GAE in Pytorch
This repository implements Y-type GAE for the paper of Shengling Duan and Jiali Feng and Yue Qi [Uniform Representation of Parametric CAD Models for Generative Application].

# Requirements

* Pytorch 
* python 3.x

# How to run
* It is necessary to prepare  the json format data for extracting the geometric and topological information of the BRep model.
* Specify your arguments in `args.py` : you can change dataset and other arguments there.
* run `python train.py`
